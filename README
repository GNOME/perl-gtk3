Gtk3
====

Perl bindings to the 3.x series of the gtk+ toolkit.  This module allows you to
write graphical user interfaces in a Perlish and object-oriented way, freeing
you from the casting and memory management in C, yet remaining very close in
spirit to original API.


INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES
------------

Gtk3 needs this C library:

  gtk+-3.0 >= 3.0.0

and these Perl modules:

  Glib::Object::Introspection >= 0.002

BUG REPORTS
-----------

For help with problems, please contact the support forum (above).  If you
already know you have a bug, please file it with one of the bug trackers
below.  With any problems and/or bug reports, it's always helpful for the
developers to have the following information:

- A small script that demonstrates the problem; this is not required, however,
  it will get your issue looked at much faster than a description of the
  problem alone.
- Version of Perl (perl -v)
- Versions of Gtk2-Perl modules (Glib/Gtk2/Pango/Cairo)
- Optional, but nice to have: versions of GTK+ libraries on your system
  (libglib, libgtk+, libpango, libcairo, etc.)

There are multiple project bug trackers, please choose the one you are most
comfortable with using and/or already have an account for.

Request Tracker:
- submitting bugs via the Web (requires a PAUSE account/Bitcard):
  https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Report.html?Queue=Gtk3
- submitting bugs via e-mail (open to anyone with e-mail):
  bug-Gtk3 [at] rt.cpan.org

GNOME's bugtracker:
- report bugs to the 'perl-gtk3' product (requires login)

PATCH SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
---------------------------

You can send us patches by...
- Creating a Merge Request in GNOME GitLab.
- Those with gnome.org Git ID's can push trivial patches to git directly; if
  you're not sure what a trivial patch is, please ask first in the support
  forum prior to pushing your commit.

OBTAINING SOURCE FROM THE GNOME.ORG GIT REPO
--------------------------------------------

Assuming you already have the 'git' command installed on your system, you can
use the 'git://' protocol:

 git clone git://git.gnome.org/perl-Gtk3

Or, read-only access via HTTP:

 git clone http://git.gnome.org/browse/perl-Gtk3

To update an existing clone of the source:

 git pull

Most Linux distros package the 'git' command in a package called either 'git'
or 'git-core'.
